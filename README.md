# DL Smart Surveillance System 🚨🎥  
> Deep Learning-based Intelligent Surveillance using Flask + OpenCV + YOLOv8  

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project is a **Deep Learning–powered Smart Surveillance System** that:
- Uses **YOLOv8 object detection** to identify people and objects in real-time.  
- Detects **major or unusual motion** (like a person walking, object falling, etc.).  
- Ignores **minor background movements** (wind, lighting, small animals).  
- **Automatically captures snapshots** of significant events.  
- Hosts a **live camera feed and gallery** on a beautiful Flask web dashboard.  
- Allows users to take **manual snapshots** with one click.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Backend Framework:** Flask
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Deep Learning:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hardware:** Any USB / inbuilt webcam (supports Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or standard PC)
